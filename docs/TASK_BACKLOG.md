# HXForge Task Backlog

This is the project-level work breakdown. Detailed executable cards for the first implementation sequence are in `docs/tasks/`.

Status values: `DONE`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `READY_FOR_REVIEW`, `READY`, `BLOCKED`, `PLANNED`.

- `READY_FOR_REVIEW` = implementation complete, engineering review passed, awaiting PR merge
- `READY` = approved dependency/task ready to start

## Next execution sequence

1. Finish TASK-000 and merge the bootstrap PR.
2. Execute TASK-001 through TASK-006 in order.
3. Execute TASK-007 through TASK-010 to deliver the first complete exchanger workflow.
4. Complete TASK-011 through TASK-019 before starting shell-and-tube development.
